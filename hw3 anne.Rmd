Homework 3
========================================================
Anne Cognet

Question 1
----------------
Read  the  World  Bank  webpage  and  store  as  a  nice  data  frame.  
Source:  The  data  can  be  found  here: http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/4.1  
Hints:  You  can  try  readHTMLTable  
We  are  interested  in  the  third  table. [[3]]  will  select  the  third  element  in  a list.  Store  as  a  data  frame.  Rename  the  columns  to  be  meaningful. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(XML)
url<-"http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/4.1"
mytable<-readHTMLTable(url, colClasses=c("character", rep("numeric",10)))[[3]]
```
I check my result
```{r,  results='hide'}
str(mytable)
```
I have a dataframe with country names as characters and other numerical columns as numbers, and a lot of NAs where there are no values.

Some cleaning up, and naming the columns
```{r}
mytable[ ,1]<-tolower(mytable[ ,1])
names(mytable)[1]<-"Country"

h1<-c("GDP","Agriculture","Industry","Manufacturing","Services")
h2<-c("1990to2000","2000to2012")

k<-2
for(i in h1) {
  for(j in h2) {
    names(mytable)[k]<-paste0(i,j)
    k<-1+k
  }
}
```
My end result looks like
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mytable[1:5,1:3]
```

Question 2
-----------
Write  an  R  function  that  will  take  the name of  a  country  and  return  its  Avg Industrial  Growth  value for 2000‐2012.(Use your dataframe as the data source for your function to look up)

```{r}
iG2000<-function(country) {
  #the function assumes my dataframe is in my environment
  country<-tolower(country)
  if (!(country %in%mytable[,"Country"])) { stop ("invalid country name")}
  
  print(paste(country,mytable[mytable$Country==country,"Industry2000to2012"],sep=" "))  
}
#I give 2 examples
iG2000("france")
iG2000("india")
```

Question 3
----------------
By  using  R  to  read  from Wikipedia,  create  a  data  frame  that  contains the names  of  countries and  their Healthcare  expenditure.  You  can  use  any wikipedia page  that  has  a  population  table  in  it.  
You  can  use any measure  of  healthcare  spending  that  you  find or  like

I will be using this page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system. It contains data about 10 countries and gives the healthcare cost as percent of GDP. I am interested in the 1st and 8th columns.
Here is what I did and the result:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
url<-"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"
mytable<-readHTMLTable(url, colClasses =c("character", rep("numeric",9)))[[1]]
healthCost<-mytable[,c(1,8)]
healthCost
```


*_BONUS_*  

As I was browsing in search of data for my project, I stumbled upon some CIA's datasets.  
They happen to have health expenditure per GDP data, so let's match wikipedia/OECD and the CIA data 
I downloaded the data from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/rawdata_2225.txt for the CIA set and http://stats.oecd.org/ for the OECD set.
After much trouble I ended up saving the data to my working directory (you can see the frustration in me going back to french)
```{r,  results='hide', warning=FALSE}
cia<-read.table("ciahealth.txt", sep="\t", quote="", 
                colClasses=c("NULL", "character", "numeric"))
cia[,1]<-tolower(cia[,1])
ocde<-read.csv("depensesSante.csv", header=T)
ocde<-within(ocde, Country<-tolower(as.character(Country)))
ocde<-within(ocde, expense<-as.numeric(as.character(expense)))
```
I merge the 2 datasets on country name. Since cia contains 190 countries and ocde 34 I expect at most 34 rows.
```{r}
cia.ocde<-merge(cia, ocde, by.x="V2", by.y="Country")
names(cia.ocde)<-c("country", "cia", "ocde")
```
I see only `r nrow(cia.ocde)` countries.
After cheking, 2 countries show a different names in the 2 data sets.
However, the most pressing issues is that only `r with(cia.ocde, sum(cia==ocde, na.rm=T))` values match.

Where is the truth, I guess worldbank data are in order.  
I could only get 2012 data, so I will have to look for similar data, not exactly matching
```{r, warning=FALSE}
url<-"http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.15"
wb<-readHTMLTable(url, colClasses=c("character", rep("numeric",10)), which=3)
wb<-wb[,1:2]
wb<-within(wb, V1<-tolower(V1))
cia.ocde.wb<-merge(cia.ocde,wb, by.x="country", by.y="V1")
colnames(cia.ocde.wb)[4]<-"wb"
```
I get an overview
```{r}
summary(cia.ocde.wb)
```
I can see the CIA and World Bank converge.  
A plot ?
```{r,  message=FALSE}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
ordered<-cia.ocde.wb[order(cia.ocde.wb$wb),]
order.melt<-melt(ordered, id.vars="country")
order.melt$country<-factor(order.melt$country, levels=unique(order.melt$country), ordered=T)
require(ggplot2)
p<-ggplot(data = order.melt, aes(x=country, y= value, colour=variable, group=variable))
p<-p + geom_line() + geom_point() +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
p                                   
```
As a conclusion, what is the OECD (ocde in french) doing ?

Question 4
------------
Read the data file: KCASANTA142.csv  
Notice	that it	has	one	column	that	has	the	time and	the	date	and	the	time combined	
Create	new	columns	for	Month,	Day,	Year,	Hour	and	Minute	in	the	data	frame.	
You	can	write	a	function	and	use	lapply()	

The file is in my working directory
```{r}
mydf<-read.csv("KCASANTA142.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
#I take my Time column and will make a list
timelist<-strsplit(mydf$Time,"\\-+|\\ |\\:")
#I reshape it as a df
library("plyr")
timedf <- ldply(timelist)
colnames(timedf) <- c("year","month","day","hour","minute","second")
#I make my nice new df
mynewdf<-cbind("temperature"=mydf$TemperatureF, timedf[,c("month","day","year",'hour',"minute")])
```
After all that I have a `r nrow(mynewdf)` by `r ncol(mynewdf)` data frame looking like
```{r}
head(mynewdf)
```

Give at most one measure per hour.

There are 2 possibilities to do so, here they are and the result
```{r}
perhour<-aggregate(temperature~hour+day+month+year, data=mynewdf, FUN=mean)
perhour2<-ddply(mynewdf,.(hour,day,month,year),summarise, meanTemp=mean(temperature))
head(perhour2)
```
